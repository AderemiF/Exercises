<h1 align="center">Day 2: Data Cleaning (Missings and Outliers)</h1>

## Exercises

### ❓ Missing values

1. What is the missing datatype used in pandas?
NaN

2. How to replace all occurences of the value 9999 to missing in pandas?
df.replace(999, np.NaN)

3. How to get the absolute number of missings for each variable in pandas?
df.isnull().sum()

4. How to get the percentage of missings for each variable in pandas?
df.isnull().sum/(len(df))*100

5. How to drop rows with missing values?
df.dropna

6. How to drop variables with missing values?
df.dropna(axis=1)

7. What is the univariate imputation method in sklearn?
SimpleImputer

8. What is the multivariate imputation method in sklearn?
IterativeImputer

9. What is the best univariate imputation method to categorical variables? (Explain why)
Constant because it is better to use a constant string as a placeholder for missing values.

10. What is the best univariate imputation method to numerical variables? (Explain why)
Statistics(especially mean) because it predicts missing value from non-missing values instead of imputing random values.

### 🔎 Outliers

1. What is an outlier?
A value that is really out of range of other values in the dataset.

2. What is a simple method to detect and deal with outliers of a numerical variable?
By visualizing the dataset using plots.

3. What is novelty detection?
It is the identification of new values to determine if they belong to the dataset or are outliers.

4. Name 4 advanced methods of outlier detection in sklearn.
Robust covariance, One Class SVM, Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor

### 🖋 Typos

1. What is a typo?
A data entry with errors.

2. What is a good method of automatically detect typos?
Using packages like fuzzywuzzy.


### Practical case

Consider the following dataset: [San Francisco Building Permits](https://www.kaggle.com/aparnashastry/building-permit-applications-data). Look at the columns "Street Number Suffix" and "Zipcode". Both of these contain missing values.

- Which, if either, are missing because they don't exist? 
Street Number Suffix
- Which, if either, are missing because they weren't recorded?
Zipcode

Hint: Do all addresses generally have a street number suffix? Do all addresses generally have a zipcode?
